                                     GUI Web Player
     An Easy to use Music Player in your browser with Graphical User Interface
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
      
      This was originaly created for my father as an updated music player for
      him, and access for the family at home to change and start music from
      anywhere in the house.

      TODO:
           - Create About Page
           - Add Video Features
           - Add Search Function
           - Add Sorting Function
           - And more when I think of them :)

      This is a simple to use online webplayer for music, and could possibly
      add video in the near future.
      
      This features a easy to use, plug 'n' play music library system, all you
      have to do, is supply the folder which has all of your music in it, and 
      the system will display any music in that folder, and also in subfolders
      as well.

    This is free-to-use, but I only ask for in return is that you put somewhere,
    where ever it is that you use the player, my name and a link back to this
    repositiory,  thanks.
